## Code

All code used for mapping of RNA sequencing read to the polished reference genome, quantification and subsequent differential expression analysis.

### Order of usage:

- code/mappings_and_quantification/
process RNA sequencing reads and remove adapters, map reads to the polished reference genome, perform quality control and quantify number of reads assigned to each gene

- code/differntial_expression_analysis/
coduct differential expression analysis using the quantified reads
