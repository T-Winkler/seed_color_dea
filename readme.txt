## Differential expression analysis using developing A. hypochondriacus seeds

Differential expression analysis of developing A. hypochondriacus seeds. After adapter trimming and quality control, mapped read pairs counts are quantified using featurecounts. Differential expression analysis between dark and white seeds is conducted using DESeq2.
